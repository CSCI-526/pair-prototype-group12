## Logline
Exodia is an ability-based card game utilizing Simultaneous Action Queues. Players strategically place cards into a shared action queue to outmaneuver their opponents.

---

## Genre Research
### Researched Titles:
1. **Legends of Runeterra**
2. **Dominion**
3. **Liarâ€™s Bar**

### Common Tropes:
- **Player Health & Resource Management**: Balancing mana, coins, and valid cards.
- **Turn-Based Strategy**: The sequence of card placement significantly impacts the game.
- **Synergistic Interactions**: Card combinations can create unexpected, satisfying effects.
- **Deck Building (Dominion)**: Players enhance their decks while removing weaker cards.

### Twist:
- **Simultaneous Action Queues**: Unlike traditional turn-based card games, all players submit their cards simultaneously, and actions are revealed together.
- **Hidden Information**: Not all played cards are revealed each turn, introducing an element of surprise.
- **Influence of Action Order**: The left-to-right resolution of the queue impacts later actions.

## Core Mechanic: Simultaneous Action Queues
Players place their selected cards into a shared action queue (e.g., size 3). The turn is resolved all at once after all players have submitted their cards.

### Selection Process:
- **Empty Slot**: No effect.
- **Single Card**: The card is revealed and activated.
- **Multiple Cards**: The card with the highest priority value is activated, while others are discarded and kept hidden.
- **Tiebreaker**: The top tied cards are revealed but not activated. The next highest priority card is then considered.
